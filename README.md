# Bayesian Modelling of excess mortality following the COVID-19 pandemic 
## BSc project - 30 credits

**Description**: Requires skills in `R` and will require some learning on Bayesian modelling. The project can be split into a couple of different sub-projects that different students can take on at the same moment. 

1. **Low/medium difficulty**: Meta-analysis of vaccination against COVID-19
   - This involves the analysis of data collected through a systematic literature review, pooling together studies involving relatively homogeneous clinical outcomes, for a single disease outcome (e.g. respiratory disease).

2. **Medium/high difficulty**: Bayesian Meta-analysis of vaccination against COVID-19
   - This expands on the above project to perform a Bayesian version of the modelling 
  
3. **High difficulty**: Bayesian Meta-analysis of vaccination against COVID-19 of heterogeneous clinical outcomes/disease areas.
   - This expands on the above projects to perform a Bayesian version of the modelling and considering outcomes that are not measured on the same scale (e.g. odds ratios, hazard ratios and relative risks), as well as across different disease outcomes (e.g. mortality and respiratory disease).
  
4. **High difficulty** Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling to estimate the excess mortality due to COVID-19
