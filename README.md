# (Bayesian) meta-analysis of vaccine interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic 
## BSc project - 30 credits

**Description**: Requires skills in `R` and may require some learning on Bayesian modelling. The basic requirement for the project is to use a systematic literature review conducted on various interventions for COVID-19 (mainly vaccines) and their various measures of effectiveness. The project can be layered and there are a number of outputs that can be achieved, from the most basic to more advanced:

- Simple meta-analysis of data about homegeneous outcomes (e.g. all studies based on odds ratios, for the same clinical outcome);
- More complex evidence synthesis pooling together data about different measures for the same clinical outcome (can be conducted using frequentist methods, but ideally using a principled Bayesian approach);
- More complex analysis pooling together data about different measures and different clinical outcomes (e.g. effect of vaccine on respiratory diseases *and* on mortality). This would be conducted under a Bayesian approach.

The data have been collected (using work done in collaboration with Moderna, one  the manufactures of one of the vaccines implemented in 2020/21 during the COVID-19 pandemic). But you will need to understand the underlying principles for systematic literature review and the actual search conducted in this case.
