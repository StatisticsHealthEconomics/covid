# Bayesian Modelling of excess mortality following the COVID-19 pandemic 
## BSc project - 30 credits
### Difficulty: :emoji-grimace: :emoji-grimace: :emoji-grimace:

**Description**: Requires skills in `R` and will require some learning on Bayesian modelling. The project can be split into a couple of different sub-projects that different students can take on at the same moment. The analyses will revolve around generalised linear models (Poisson regression) and may include extensions to spatio-temporal modelling.
